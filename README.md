Warning! This is rpclib's unstable development branch. Not only that, but rpclib
project is experimental. You have been warned.

Warning! The documentation is useless! To get some examples, look at the tests.

Overview
========

What is rpclib?
----------------

Rpclib is a library for publishing services that uses various protocols and
transports. Currently, it supports WSDL 1.1 interface to publish services
that use SOAP 1.1 or the (Rest-minus-the-verbs) HttpRPC protocol over either
ZeroMQ or HTTP (using WSGI).

With a very small amount of code, rpclib allows you to write a useful remote
procedure call pack and deploy it using your transport of choice.

The official rpclib discussion forum can be found [here](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/soap).

See the [downloads section](http://github.com/arskom/rpclib/downloads) for related downloads.

Rpclib is a generalized version of a soap processing library known as soaplib.
The legacy versions of soaplib are also available in this repository.
See [here](http://github.com/arskom/rpclib/tree/soaplib-0_8) for the stable soaplib-0.8 branch.
See [here](http://github.com/arskom/rpclib/tree/soaplib-1_0) for the stable soaplib-1.0 branch.
See [here](http://github.com/arskom/rpclib/tree/soaplib-2_0) for the stable soaplib-2.0 branch.

Features
--------
* Handles all (de)serialization.
* On-demand WSDL generation.
* Powerful customization features to support many use-cases.

Runtime Requirements
--------------------
* Python 2.4 through 2.7 (looking for volunteers to test Python 3.x)
* A WSGI-compliant web server for http services. (CherryPy, WSGIUtils, Twisted, etc.)
* [lxml](http://codespeak.net/lxml/) for soap. (available through easy_install)
* [pytz](http://pytz.sourceforge.net/) (available through easy_install)

See the examples directory in the source distribution for deployment
examples. Rpclib services have been successfully run on the following web
servers:

* CherryPy 2.2
* Flup
* twisted.web (8.2, 9.0)
* WSGIUtils 0.9

Development Requirements
------------------------
* Most examples and tests require Python 2.5 and greater. You need Python 2.7 to
  run all of the tests.
* Twisted is required for `rpclib.test.interop.server.basic` and
  `rpclib.test.interop.server.static`.
* To run automated tests, see instructions under test/README
