Welcome to Spyne documentation! We hope you find it ...

Um, well actually Spyne 2.11 docs are not quite done yet.

Spyne 2.11 has been in the making for more than a year and received around 1400
commits on top of the 2.10 branch.

So the documentation is a huge TBD at the moment. There's the migration guide,
and that's that.

Yet, we tried very hard to keep backwards compatibility. Which means your
existing (correct) code should work out of the box with 2.11. Which in turn
means you can safely use 2.10 docs, they're still quite relevant.

Please report any issue that is not documented in the migration guide to the
Spyne issue tracker that can be found at: https://github.com/arskom/spyne/issues

So, here's a link to the 2.10 docs: http://spyne.io/docs/2.10/

Please read the migration guide first if you're migrating from 2.10.x to 2.11.

Have fun!

PS: Feedback about the docs are pure gold to us, simply because the most
important thing the Spyne committers lack is an outside perspective to the
project. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with us via people@spyne.io

PS2: Why did we not publish 2.11 docs verbatim and update it along the way?
Because we *hate* broken documentation links.
