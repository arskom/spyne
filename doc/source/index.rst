Spyne Documentation

Actually, Spyne 2.11 docs are not quite done yet.

Spyne 2.11 has been in the making for more than a year and received around 1400
commits on top of the 2.10 branch.

So the documentation is a huge TBD at the moment. There's the migration guide,
the changelog and that's that.

Yet, we tried very hard to keep backwards compatibility. Which means your
existing (correct) code should work without any changes with 2.11. Which in turn
means you can safely refer to the 2.10 docs, they're still quite relevant.

Don't forget to read the migration guide first if you're migrating from 2.10 to
2.11 though, there were still some changes that can break existing code.

But most important of it all, Have fun!

PS: Feedback about the docs are pure gold to us, simply because the most
important thing the Spyne committers lack is an outside perspective to the
project. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with us via people@spyne.io

PPS: Why did we not publish 2.11 docs verbatim and update it along the way?
Because we *hate* broken documentation links.
