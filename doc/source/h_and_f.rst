Versioning
==========

Spyne respects the "Semantic Versioning" rules outlined in http://semver.org.

This means  you can do better than just adding ``'spyne'`` to your list of
dependencies. Assuming the current version of spyne is 2.4.8,
you can use the following as dependency string:

* ``spyne`` if you feel adventurous or are willing to work on spyne itself.
* ``spyne<2.99`` if you only want backwards-compatible bug fixes and new
  features.
* ``spyne<2.4.99`` if you only want backwards-compatible bug fixes.
* ``spyne=2.4.8`` if you rather like that version.

We have a policy of pushing to pypi as soon as possible, so be sure to at
least use the second option to prevent things from breaking unexpectedly. It's
recommended to use the third option in you production and only upgrade after
you've tested new Spyne in your staging environment. While we make every effort
to keep to our compatibility promise, Spyne is a fast moving open-source
project that may break in ways that can't be cought by our test suite between
feature releases.

Spyne project uses -alpha -beta and -rc labels to denote unfinished code. We
don't prefer using separate integers for experimental labels. So for example,
instead of having 2.0.0-alpha47, we'll have 2.2.5-alpha.

* **-alpha** means unstable code. You may not recognize the project next time
  you look at it.
* **-beta** means stable(ish) api, unstable behavior, there are bugs everywhere!
  Don't be upset if some quirks that you rely on disappear.
* **-rc** means it's been working in production sans issues for some time on
  beta-testers' sites, but we'd still like it to have tested by a few more
  people.

These labels apply to the project as a whole. Thus, we won't tag the whole
project as beta because some new feature is not yet well-tested, but we will
clearly denote experimental code in its documentation.

.. include:: ../../CHANGELOG.rst

spyne-2.9.5
-----------
* Fix restriction bases of simple types not being imported.
* Fix for customized subclasses forgetting about their empty base classes.
* Fix Attributes.nullable not surviving customization.

spyne-2.9.4
-----------
* Fix for Python 2.6 quirk where any ``decimal.Decimal()`` is always less than
  any ``float()``. Where did that come from?!
* Fix missing '/' in WsgiMounter.
* Fix confusion in ``spyne.model.primitive.Decimal``'s parameter order.
* Add forgotten ``HttpBase`` parameters to ``WsgiApplication``.

spyne-2.9.3
-----------

* Fix TwistedWebResource choking on generators as return values.
* Fix Csv serializer.

spyne-2.9.2
-----------
* Fix Array serialization for Html Microformats
* Fix deserialization of Fault objects for Soap11
* Fix Uuid not playing well with soft validation.
* Fix Uuid not playing well with Xml Schema document.

spyne-2.9.0
-----------
* Spyne is now stable!
* Fix document_built events by adding a ``doc`` attribute to the ServerBase
  class. You can now do ``some_server.doc.wsdl11.event_manager.add_listener``
  to add events to interface documents.
* Add wsdl_document_built and xml_document_built events to relevant classes.
* Behavioral change for TableModel's relationship handling: It's now an array
  by default. The TableModel is deprecated, long live __metadata__ on
  ComplexModel!
* First-class integration with Pyramid.
* First geospatial types: Point and Polygon.
* Initial revision of the http request pattern matching support via
  ``werkzeug.routing``.
* ``XmlObject`` -> ``XmlDocument``, ``JsonObject`` -> ``JsonDocument``,
  ``MessagePackObject`` -> ``MessagePackDocument``,
  ``DictObject`` -> ``DictDocument``.

spyne-2.8.2-rc
--------------
* travis-ci.org integration! See for yourself: http://travis-ci.org/arskom/spyne
* Python 2.4 compatibility claim was dropped, because this particular Python
  version is nowhere to be found.
* Many issues with Python 2.5 compatibility are fixed.

spyne-2.8.1-rc
--------------
* Misc fixes regarding the spyne.model.binary.File api.

rpclib-2.8.0-rc -> spyne-2.8.0-rc
---------------------------------
* Rpclib is dead. Long live Spyne!
* Add support for JsonObject protocol. This initial version is expremental.
* Add support for MessagePackObject and MessagePackRpc protocols. These
  initial versions are expremental.
* Make DateTime string format customizable.
* Implement TwistedWebResource that exposes an ``Application`` instance as a
  ``twisted.web.resource.Resource`` child.
* Remove Deprecated ``XMLAttribute`` and ``XMLAttributeRef``. Use
  ``XmlAttribute`` and ``XmlAttributeRef`` instead.
* Xml Schema: Add support for the <any> tag.
* Add a chapter about Validation to the manual. Thanks Alex!
* Interface documents are no longer subclasses of InterfaceBase. It's up
  to the transport to expose the application using a given interface document
  standard now. The ``interface`` argument to the ``Application`` constructor
  is now ignored.
* Html: Added a very simple lxml-based templating scheme: ``HtmlPage``.
* Html: Added row-based tables: They show fields in rows. It's good for
  showing one object per table.
* Html: Added ImageUri support. They render as <img> tags in Html output.
* Html: Added support for locales. You can now render field names as human-
  readable strings.
* Add support for async methods, which execute after the primary user code
  returns. Currently, the only async execution method is via threads.
* Xml & friends: Start tags are now in the same namespace as the definitions
  themselves. Intermediate tags are in the parent's namespace, just as before.
* Xml & friends: Make the 'bare' mode work.
* spyne.util.xml: ``get_object_as_xml`` can also get class suggestion.
* spyne.util.xml: ``get_xml_as_object`` has argument order swapped:
  cls, elt -> elt, cls. See ab91a3e2ad4756b71d1a2752e5b0d2af8551e061.
* There's a final argument order change in Application ctor:

      in_protocol, out_protocol, interface, name

  becomes:

      name, in_protocol, out_protocol, interface

-----------------
* Add support for non-chunked encoding to Wsgi transport.
* Add support for Html Microformats.
* Add ``function`` property to MethodContext that is re-initialized from
  ``descriptor.function`` for each new request. Stay away from
  ``descriptor.function`` unless you understand the consequences!..
* String and Unicode models are now separate objects with well-defined
  (de)serialization behaviour.
* Argument order change in Application ctor: ::

      interface, in_protocol, out_protocol

  becomes: ::

      in_protocol, out_protocol, interface

-----------------
* Fix (for real this time) the race condition in wsgi server's wsdl handler.

rpclib-2.6.0-beta
-----------------
* HttpRpc now parses POST/PUT/PATCH bodies, can accept file uploads.
  Uses werkzeug to do that, which is now a soft dependency.

                   https://github.com/arskom/spyne/pull/116

rpclib-2.5.0-beta
-----------------
* Implemented fanout support for transports and protocols that can handle
  that.
* Implemented a helper module that generates a Soap/Wsdl 1.1 application in
  ``rpclib.util.simple``
* Some work towards supporting Python3 using ``2to3``. See issue #113.

* Full change log: https://github.com/arskom/spyne/pull/109

rpclib-2.4.3-beta
-----------------
* Many issues with 'soft' validation was fixed.
* ``MethodDescriptor.udp`` added. Short for "User-Defined Properties", you can
  use it to store arbitrary metadata about the decorated method.
* Fix HttpRpc response serialization.
* Documentation updates.

rpclib-2.4.1-beta

rpclib-2.4.0-beta
-----------------
* Fixed Fault publishing in Wsdl.

* A bug with min/max_occurs logic was fixed. This causes rpclib not to send
  null values for elements with min_occurs=0 (the default value).
* Native value for ``rpclib.model.primitive.String`` was changed to
  ``unicode``. To exchange raw data, you should use
  ``rpclib.model.binary.ByteArray``.
* Full change log: https://github.com/arskom/spyne/pull/90

rpclib-2.3.3-beta
-----------------
* Added MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH = 2 * 1024 * 1024 and BLOCK_LENGTH = 8 * 1024
  constants to rpclib.server.wsgi module.
* rpclib.model.binary.Attachment is deprecated, and is replaced by ByteArray.
  The native format of ByteArray is an iterable of strings.
* Exception handling was formalized. HTTP return codes can be set by exception
  classes from rpclib.error or custom exceptions.

* Added missing event firings.
* Documented event api and fundamental data structures (rpclib._base)
* Full change log: https://github.com/arskom/spyne/pull/87

rpclib-2.3.1-beta
-----------------
* HttpRpc protocol now returns 404 when a requested resource was not found.
* New tests added for HttpRpc protocol.
* Miscellanous other fixes. See: https://github.com/arskom/spyne/pull/86

rpclib-2.3.0-beta
-----------------
* Documentation improvements.
* rpclib.protocol.xml.XmlObject is now working as out_protocol.
* Many fixes.

* Fixed HttpRpc server transport instantiation.
* Documentation improvements.

rpclib-2.2.1-beta
-----------------
* rpclib.application.Application.call_wrapper introduced
* Documentation improvements.

rpclib-2.2.0-beta
-----------------
* The serialization / deserialization logic was redesigned. Now most of the
  serialization-related logic is under the responsibility of the ProtocolBase
  children.
* Interface generation logic was redesigned. The WSDL logic is separated to
  XmlSchema and Wsdl11 classes. 'add_to_schema' calls were renamed to just
  'add' and were moved inside rpclib.interface.xml_schema package.
* Interface and Protocol assignment of an rpclib application is now more
  explicit. Both are also configurable during instantion. This doesn't mean
  there's much to configure :)
* WS-I Conformance is back!. See https://github.com/arskom/spyne/blob/master/src/rpclib/test/interop/wsi-report-rpclib.xml
  for the latest conformance report.
* Numeric types now support range restrictions. e.g. Integer(ge=0) will only
  accept positive integers.
* Any -> AnyXml, AnyAsDict -> AnyDict. AnyAsDict is not the child of the AnyXml
  anymore.
* rpclib.model.exception -> rpclib.model.fault.

rpclib-2.1.0-alpha
------------------
* The method dispatch logic was rewritten: It's now possible for the protocols
  to override how method request strings are matched to methods definitions.
* Unsigned integer primitives were added.
* ZeroMQ client was fixed.
* Header confusion in native http soap client was fixed.
* Grouped transport-specific context information under ctx.transport
  attribute.
* Added a self reference mechanism.

rpclib-2.0.10-alpha
-------------------
* The inclusion of base xml schemas were made optional.
* WSDL: Fix out header being the same as in header.
* Added type checking to outgoing Integer types. it's not handled as nicely as
  it should be.
* Fixed the case where changing the _in_message tag name of the method
  prevented it from being called.
* SOAP/WSDL: Added support for multiple {in,out}_header objects.
* Fix some XMLAttribute bugs.

rpclib-2.0.9-alpha
------------------
* Added inheritance support to rpclib.model.table.TableSerializer.

rpclib-2.0.8-alpha
------------------
* The NullServer now also returns context with the return object to have it
  survive past user-defined method return.

rpclib-2.0.7-alpha
------------------
* More tests are migrated to the new api.
* Function identifier strings are no more created directly from the function
  object itself. Function's key in the class definition is used as default
  instead.
* Base xml schemas are no longer imported.

rpclib-2.0.6-alpha
------------------
* Added rpclib.server.null.NullServer, which is a server class with a client
  interface that attempts to do no (de)serialization at all. It's intended to
  be used in tests.

rpclib-2.0.5-alpha
------------------
* Add late mapping support to sqlalchemy table serializer.

rpclib-2.0.4-alpha
------------------
* Add preliminary support for a sqlalchemy-0.7-compatible serializer.

rpclib-2.0.3-alpha
------------------
* Migrate the HttpRpc serializer to the new internal api.

rpclib-2.0.2-alpha
------------------
* SimpleType -> SimpleModel
* Small bugfixes.

rpclib-2.0.1-alpha
------------------
* EventManager now uses ordered sets instead of normal sets to store event
  handlers.
* Implemented sort_wsdl, a small hack to sort wsdl output in order to ease
  debugging.

rpclib-2.0.0-alpha
------------------
* Implemented EventManager and replaced hook calls with events.
* The rpc decorator now produces static methods. The methods still get an implicit
  first argument that holds the service contexts. It's an instance of the
  MethodContext class, and not the ServiceBase (formerly DefinitionBase) class.
* The new srpc decorator doesn't force the methods to have an implicit first
  argument.
* Fixed fault namespace resolution.
* Moved xml constants to rpclib.const.xml_ns
* The following changes to soaplib were ported to rpclib's SOAP/WSDL parts:
   * duration object is now compatible with Python's native timedelta.
   * WSDL: Support for multiple <service> tags in the wsdl (one for each class in the
     application)
   * WSDL: Support for multiple <portType> tags and multiple ports.
   * WSDL: Support for enumerating exceptions a method can throw was added.
   * SOAP: Exceptions got some love to be more standards-compliant.
   * SOAP: Xml attribute support
* Moved all modules with packagename.base to packagename._base.
* Renamed classes to have module name as a prefix:
   * rpclib.client._base.Base -> rpclib.client._base.ClientBase
   * rpclib.model._base.Base -> rpclib.model._base.ModelBase
   * rpclib.protocol._base.Base -> rpclib.protocol._base.ProtocolBase
   * rpclib.server._base.Base -> rpclib.server._base.ServerBase
   * rpclib.service.DefinitionBase -> rpclib.service.ServiceBase
   * rpclib.server.wsgi.Application  -> rpclib.server.wsgi.WsgiApplication
* Moved some classes and modules around:
   * rpclib.model.clazz -> rpclib.model.complex
   * rpclib.model.complex.ClassSerializer -> rpclib.model.complex.ComplexModel
   * rpclib.Application -> rpclib.application.Application
   * rpclib.service.rpc, srpc -> rpclib.decorator.rpc, srpc

soaplib-3.x -> rpclib-1.1.1-alpha
---------------------------------
* Soaplib is now also protocol agnostic. As it now supports protocols other
  than soap (like Rest-minus-the-verbs HttpRpc), it's renamed to rpclib. This
  also means soaplib can now support multiple versions of soap and wsdl
  standards.
* Mention of xml and soap removed from public api where it's not directly
  related to soap or xml. (e.g. a hook rename: on_method_exception_xml ->
  on_method_exception_doc)
* Protocol serializers now return iterables instead of complete messages. This
  is a first step towards eliminating the need to have the whole message in
  memory during processing.

soaplib-2.x
-----------
* This release transformed soaplib from a soap server that exclusively supported
  http to a soap serialization/deserialization library that is architecture and
  transport agnostic.
* Hard dependency on WSGI removed.
* Sphinx docs with working examples: http://arskom.github.com/soaplib/
* Serializers renamed to Models.
* Standalone xsd generation for ClassSerializer objects has been added. This
  allows soaplib to be used to define generic XML schemas, without SOAP
  artifacts.
* Annotation Tags for primitive Models has been added.
* The soaplib client has been re-written after having been dropped from
  recent releases. It follows the suds API but is based on lxml for better
  performance.
  WARNING: the soaplib client is not well-tested and future support is tentative
  and dependent on community response.
* 0mq support added.
* Twisted supported via WSGI wrappers.
* Increased test coverage for soaplib and supported servers

soaplib-1.0
-----------
* Standards-compliant Soap Faults
* Allow multiple return values and return types

soaplib-0.9.4
-------------
* pritimitive.Array -> clazz.Array
* Support for SimpleType restrictions (pattern, length, etc.)

soaplib-0.9.3
-------------
* Soap header support
* Tried the WS-I Test first time. Many bug fixes.

soaplib-0.9.2
-------------
* Support for inheritance.

soaplib-0.9.1
-------------
* Support for publishing multiple service classes.

soaplib-0.9
-----------
* Soap server logic almost completely rewritten.
* Soap client removed in favor of suds.
* Object definition api no longer needs a class types: under class definition.
* XML Schema validation is supported.
* Support for publishing multiple namespaces. (multiple <schema> tags in the wsdl)
* Support for enumerations.
* Application and Service Definition are separated. Application is instantiated
  on server start, and Service Definition is instantiated for each new request.
* @soapmethod -> @rpc

soaplib-0.8.1
-------------
* Switched to lxml for proper xml namespace support.

soaplib-0.8.0
-------------
* First public stable release.
