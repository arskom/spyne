Introduction
============

Rpclib is yet another python library that you can use to expose your api to the
mindbogglingly vast internets.

Contrary to the zero-tolerance-against-boilerplate mindset that dominates the
majority of the Python world, rpclib tolerates a minimum amount of boilerplate
that creeps in from here and there to give you the power to rigorously define
and validate your input, and expose it using the protocol, transport and
interface document standard of your choice.
