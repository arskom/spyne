Working with RPC Metadata
=========================

This section builds on :ref:`manual-user-manager` section. If you havenâ€™t done
so, we recommended you to read it first.

In most of the real-world scenarios, an rpc request comes with additional
baggage like authentication headers, routing history, and similar information.
Rpclib comes with rich mechanisms that lets you deal with both protocol and
transport metadata.

At the protocol level, the input and the output of the rpc function itself
are kept in ``ctx.in_object`` and ``ctx.out_object`` attributes of the
:class:`rpclib.MethodContext` whereas the protocol metadata reside in
``ctx.in_header`` and ``ctx.out_header`` attributes.

You can set values to the header attributes in the function bodies or events.
You just need to heed the order the events are fired, so that you don't
overwrite data.

If you want to use headers in a function, you must denote it either in the
decorator or the :class:`rpclib.service.ServiceBase` child that you use to
expose your functions.

A full example using most of the available metadata functionality is available
here: https://github.com/plq/rpclib/blob/master/examples/authenticate/server_soap.py

Protocol Headers
----------------

The protocol headers are available in ``ctx.in_header`` and ``ctx.out_header``
objects. You should set the ``ctx.out_header`` to the native value of the
declared type.

Header objects are defined just like any other object: ::

    class RequestHeader(ComplexModel):
        user_name = Mandatory.String
        session_id = Mandatory.String

They can be integrated to the rpc definition either by denoting it in the
service definition: ::

    preferences_db = {}

    class UserService(ServiceBase):
        __tns__ = 'rpclib.examples.authentication'
        __in_header__ = RequestHeader

        @rpc(_returns=Preferences)
        def get_preferences(ctx):
            retval = preferences_db[ctx.in_header.user_name]

            return retval

Or in the decorator: ::

        @rpc(_in_header=RequestHeader, _returns=Preferences)

It's generally a better idea to set the header types in the ServiceBase child
as it's likely that a lot of methods will use it. This will avoid cluttering the
service definition with header declarations. The header declaration in the
decorator will overwrite the one in the service definition.

Among the protocols that support headers, only Soap is supported.

Transport Headers
-----------------

There is currently no general transport header api -- transport-specific apis
should be used for setting headers.

:class:`rpclib.server.wsgi.WsgiApplication`:
    The ``ctx.transport.resp_headers`` attribute is a dict made of header/value
    pairs, both strings.

Exceptions
----------

The base class for public exceptions in rpclib is
:class:`rpclib.model.fault.Fault`. The Fault object adheres to the
`SOAP 1.1 Fault definition <http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SOAP-20000508/#_Toc478383507>`_,
which has three main attributes:

    #. ``faultcode``: is a dot-delimited string whose first part is either
       'Client' or 'Server'. Just like HTTP 4xx and 5xx codes, 'Client' indicates
       that something was wrong with the input, and 'Server' indicates something
       went wrong during the processing of the otherwise legitimate request.

       Protocol implementors should heed the values in ``faultcode`` to set
       proper return codes in the protocol level when necessary. E.g. HttpRpc
       protocol will return a HTTP 404 error when a
       :class:`rpclib.error.ResourceNotFound` is raised, and a general HTTP 400
       when the ``faultcode`` starts with 'Client.'.
    #. ``faultstring``: is the human-readable explanation of the exception.
    #. ``detail``: is the additional information as a valid xml document.

Here's how you define your own public exceptions: ::

    class PublicKeyError(Fault):
        __type_name__ = 'KeyError'
        __namespace__ = 'rpclib.examples.authentication'

        def __init__(self, value):
            Fault.__init__(self,
                    faultcode='Client.KeyError',
                    faultstring='Value %r not found' % value
                )

Let's modify the python dict to throw our own exception class: ::

    class RpclibDict(dict):
        def __getitem__(self, key):
            try:
                return dict.__getitem__(self, key)
            except KeyError:
                raise PublicKeyError(key)

We can now modify the decorator to expose the exception this service can throw: ::

    preferences_db = RpclibDict()

    class UserService(ServiceBase):
        __tns__ = 'rpclib.examples.authentication'
        __in_header__ = RequestHeader

        @rpc(_throws=PublicKeyError, _returns=Preferences)
        def get_preferences(ctx):
            retval = preferences_db[ctx.in_header.user_name]

            return retval

While this is not really necessary in the world of the dynamic languages, it'd
still be nice to specify the exceptions your service can throw in the interface
document. Plus, intefacing with your services will just feel more natural with
languages like Java where exceptions are kept on a short leash.

With this document, you know most of what rpclib has to offer for application
programmers. You can refer to the :ref:`manual-t-and-p` section if you want to
implement your own transports and protocols.

Otherwise, please refer to the rest of the documentation or the mailing list
if you have further questions.
