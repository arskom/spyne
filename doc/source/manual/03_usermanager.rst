User Manager
============

This tutorial builds on the :ref:`manual-helloworld` tutorial. If you haven't
done so, we recommended you to read it first.

In this tutorial, we will talk about:

* Defining complex types.
* Customizing types.
* Defining events.

The simple example that we are going to be studying here using complex, nested
data is available here:
http://github.com/arskom/spyne/blob/master/examples/user_manager/server_basic.py

Jumping into what's new: Spyne uses ``ComplexModel`` as a general type that,
when subclassed, will produce complex serializable types that can be used in a
public service. The ``Permission`` class is a fairly simple class with just
two members: ::

    class Permission(ComplexModel):
        application = Unicode
        feature = Unicode

Let's also look at the ``User`` class: ::

    class User(ComplexModel):
        user_id = Integer
        username = Unicode
        firstname = Unicode
        lastname = Unicode

Nothing new so far.

Below, you can see that the ``email`` member which has a regular expression
restriction defined. The ``Unicode`` type accepts other restrictions, please
refer to the :class:`spyne.model.primitive.Unicode` documentation for more
information: ::

        email = Unicode(pattern=r'\b[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b')

The ``permissions`` attribute is an array, whose native type is a ``list`` of
``Permission`` objects. ::

        permissions = Array(Permission)

The following is deserialized as a generator, but looks the same from the
points of view of protocol and interface documents: ::

        permissions = Iterable(Permission)

The following is deserialized as a list of ``Permission`` objects, just like with
the ``Array`` example, but is shown and serialized differently in Wsdl and Soap
representations. ::

        permissions = Permission.customize(max_occurs='unbounded')

With the ``Array`` and ``Iterable`` types, a container class wraps multiple
occurences of the inner data type. So ``Array(Permission)`` is actually
equivalent to: ::

        class PermissionArray(ComplexModel):
            Permisstion = Permission.customize(max_occurs='unbounded')

Here, we need to use the :func:`spyne.model._base.ModelBase.customize` call
because calling a ``ComplexModel`` subclass instantiates that class, whereas
calling a ``SimpleModel`` child implicitly calls the ``.customize`` method of
that class.

The ``customize`` function just sets given arguments as class attributes to
``cls.Attributes`` class. You can refer to the documentation of each class to
see which member of the ``Attributes`` class is used for the given object.

Here, we define a function to be called for every method call. It instantiates
the ``UserDefinedContext`` class and sets it to the context object's ``udc``
attribute, which is in fact short for 'User Defined Context'. ::

    def _on_method_call(ctx):
        ctx.udc = UserDefinedContext()

We register it to the application's 'method_call' handler. ::

    application.event_manager.add_listener('method_call', _on_method_call)

Note that registering it to the service definition's event manager would have
the same effect, but it'd have to be set for every service definition: ::

    UserManagerService.event_manager.add_listener('method_call', _on_method_call)

You can also prefer to define your own ``ServiceBase`` class and use it as a
base class throughout your projects: ::

    class MyServiceBase(ServiceBase):
        pass

    MyServiceBase.event_manager.add_listener('method_call', _on_method_call)

Next, we define the UserDefinedContext object. It's just a regular python class
with no specific api it should adhere to, other than your own. ::

    class UserDefinedContext(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self.users = _user_database

        @staticmethod
        def get_next_user_id():
            global _user_id_seq

            _user_id_seq += 1

            return _user_id_seq

Such custom objects could be used to manage everything from transactions to
logging or to performance measurements. You can have a look at the
`events.py example <http://github.com/arskom/spyne/blob/master/examples/user_manager/server_basic.py>`_
in the examples directory in the source distribution for an example on using
events to measure method performance)

What's next?
------------

This tutorial walks you through what you need to know to expose more complex
services. You can read the :ref:`manual-sqlalchemy` document where the
:class:`spyne.model.table.TableModel` class and its helpers are introduced.
You can also have look at the :ref:`manual-validation` section where Spyne's
imperative and declarative input validation features are introduced.

Otherwise, please refer to the rest of the documentation or the mailing list
if you have further questions.
