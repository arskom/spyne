Implementing Transports and Protocols
=====================================

Some preliminary information would be handy before delving into details:

How Exactly is User Code Wrapped?
---------------------------------

Here's what happens when a request arrives to a Spyne server:

The server transport decides whether this is a simple interface document request
or a remote procedure call request. Every transport has its own way of dealing
with this.

If the incoming request was for the interface document, it's easy: The interface
document needs to be generated and returned as a nice chunk of strings to the
client.
The server transport first calls
:func:`spyne.interface._base.InterfaceBase.build_interface_document`
which builds and caches the document and later calls the
:func:`spyne.interface._base.InterfaceBase.get_interface_document` that returns
the cached document.

If it was an RPC request, here's what happens:

#. The server must set the ``ctx.in_string`` attribute to an iterable of
   strings. This will contain the incoming byte stream.
#. The server calls the :class:`spyne.server._base.ServerBase.get_in_object`
   function from its parent class.
#. The server then calls the ``create_in_document``,
   ``decompose_incoming_envelope``
   and ``deserialize`` functions from the protocol class in the ``in_protocol``
   attribute. The first call parses
   incoming stream to the protocol serializer's internal representation. This
   is then split to header and body parts by the second call and deserialized to
   the native python representation by the third call.
#. The server then calls ``get_out_object`` which in turn calls the
   :func:`spyne.application.Application.process_request`
   function.
#. The ``process_request`` function fires relevant events and calls the
   :func:`spyne.application.Application.call_wrapper` function.
   This function is overridable by user, but the overriding function must call
   the one in :class:`spyne.application.Application`.
#. The ``call_wrapper`` function in
   turn calls the :func:`spyne.service.ServiceBase.call_wrapper` function,
   which has has the same requirements.
#. The :func:`spyne.service.ServiceBase.call_wrapper` finally calls the user
   function, and the value is returned to ``process_request`` call, which sets
   the return value to ``ctx.out_object``.
#. The server object now calls the ``get_out_string`` function to put the
   response as an iterable of strings in ``ctx.out_string``. The
   ``get_out_string`` function in turn calls the ``serialize`` and
   ``create_out_string`` functions of the protocol class.
#. The server pushes the stream from ctx.out_string back to the client.

The same logic applies to client transports, in reverse.

So if you want to implement a new transport or protocol, all you need to do is
to subclass the relevant base class and implement the missing methods.

A Transport Example: A DB-Backed Fan-Out Queue
-----------------------------------------------

Here's the source code in one file:
https://github.com/arskom/spyne/blob/master/examples/queue.py

The following block of code is SQLAlchemy boilerplate for creating the database
and other related machinery. Under normal conditions, you should pass the
sqlalchemy url to the Producer and Consumer instances instead of the connection
object itself, but here as we deal with an in-memory database, global variable
ugliness is just a nicer way to pass database handles. ::

    db = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')
    metadata = MetaData(bind=db)
    DeclarativeBase = declarative_base(metadata=metadata)

This is the table where queued messages are stored. Note that it's a vanilla
SQLAlchemy object: ::

    class TaskQueue(DeclarativeBase):
        __tablename__ = 'task_queue'

        id = Column(sqlalchemy.Integer, primary_key=True)
        data = Column(sqlalchemy.LargeBinary, nullable=False)

This is the table where the task id of the last processed task for each worker
is stored. Workers are identified by an integer. ::

    class WorkerStatus(DeclarativeBase):
        __tablename__ = 'worker_status'

        worker_id = Column(sqlalchemy.Integer, nullable=False, primary_key=True,
                                                            autoincrement=False)
        task_id = Column(sqlalchemy.Integer, ForeignKey(TaskQueue.id),
                                                                 nullable=False)

The consumer is a :class:`spyne.server._base.ServerBase` child that receives
requests by polling the database.

The transport is for displaying it in the Wsdl. While it's irrelevant here, it's
nice to put it in: ::

    class Consumer(ServerBase):
        transport = 'http://sqlalchemy.persistent.queue/'

We set the incoming values, create a database connection and set it to
`self.session`: ::

        def __init__(self, db, app, consumer_id):
            ServerBase.__init__(self, app)

            self.session = sessionmaker(bind=db)()
            self.id = consumer_id

We also query the worker status table and get the id for the first task. If
there is no record for own worker id, the server bootstraps its state: ::

            try:
                self.session.query(WorkerStatus) \
                            .filter_by(worker_id=self.id).one()
            except NoResultFound:
                self.session.add(WorkerStatus(worker_id=self.id, task_id=0))
                self.session.commit()

This is the main loop for our server: ::

        def serve_forever(self):
            while True:

We first get the id of the last processed task: ::

                last = self.session.query(WorkerStatus).with_lockmode("update") \
                            .filter_by(worker_id=self.id).one()

Which is used to get the next tasks to process: ::

                task_queue = self.session.query(TaskQueue) \
                        .filter(TaskQueue.id > last.task_id) \
                        .order_by(TaskQueue.id)

Each task is an rpc request, so we create a :class:`spyne.MethodContext`
instance for each task and set transport-specific data to the ``ctx.transport``
object: ::

                for task in task_queue:
                    ctx = MethodContext(self.app)
                    ctx.in_string = [task.data]
                    ctx.transport.consumer_id = self.id
                    ctx.transport.task_id = task.id

This call parses the incoming request: ::

                    self.get_in_object(ctx)

In case of an error when parsing the request, the server logs the error and
continues to process the next task in queue. The ``get_out_string`` call is
smart enough to notice and serialize the error. If this was a normal server,
we'd worry about returning the error to the client as well as logging it. ::

                    if ctx.in_error:
                        self.get_out_string(ctx)
                        logging.error(''.join(ctx.out_string))
                        continue

As the request was parsed correctly, the user method can be called to process
the task: ::

                    self.get_out_object(ctx)

The server should not care whether the error was an expected or unexpected one.
So the error is logged and the server continues to process the next task in
queue. ::

                    if ctx.out_error:
                        self.get_out_string(ctx)
                        logging.error(''.join(ctx.out_string))
                        continue

If task processing went fine, the server serializes the out object and logs that
instead. ::

                    self.get_out_string(ctx)
                    logging.debug(''.join(ctx.out_string))

Finally, the task is marked as processed.

                    last.task_id = task.id
                    self.session.commit()

Once all tasks in queue are consumed, the server waits a pre-defined amount of
time before polling the database for new tasks: ::

            time.sleep(10)

This concludes the worker implementation. But how do we put tasks in the task
queue? That's the job of the ``Producer`` class that is implemented as a Spyne
client.

Implementing clients is a two-stage operation. The main transport logic is in
the :class:`spyne.client.RemoteProcedureBase` child that is a native Python
callable whose function is to serialize the arguments, send it to the server,
receive the reply, deserialize it and pass the return value to the python
caller. However, in our case, the client does not return anything as calls are
processed asyncronously and the return values are ignored.

We start with the constructor, where we initialize the SQLAlchemy database
connection factory: ::

    class RemoteProcedure(RemoteProcedureBase):
        def __init__(self, db, app, name, out_header):
            RemoteProcedureBase.__init__(self, db, app, name, out_header)

            self.Session = sessionmaker(bind=db)

The implementation of the client is much simpler because we trust that the
Spyne code will do The Right Thing. Here, we serialize the arguments: ::

        def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            session = self.Session()

            self.get_out_object(args, kwargs)
            self.get_out_string()

            out_string = ''.join(self.ctx.out_string)

And put the resulting bytestream to the database: ::

            session.add(TaskQueue(data=out_string))
            session.commit()
            session.close()

Again, here the function does not return anything because this is an asyncronous
client.

Here's the ``Producer`` class whose sole purpose is to initialize the right
callable factory. ::

    class Producer(ClientBase):
        def __init__(self, db, app):
            ClientBase.__init__(self, db, app)

            self.service = Service(RemoteProcedure, db, app)

This is the worker service that will process the tasks. ::

    class AsyncService(ServiceBase):
        @rpc(Integer)
        def sleep(ctx, integer):
            print "Sleeping for %d seconds..." % (integer)
            time.sleep(integer)

And this event is here to do some logging. ::

    def _on_method_call(ctx):
        print "This is worker id %d, processing task id %d." % (
                               ctx.transport.consumer_id, ctx.transport.task_id)

    AsyncService.event_manager.add_listener('method_call', _on_method_call)

It's now time to deploy our service. We start by configuring the logger and
creating the necessary sql tables: ::

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
        logging.getLogger('sqlalchemy.engine.base.Engine').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

        metadata.create_all()

We then initialize our application: ::

        application = Application([AsyncService], 'spyne.async',
                interface=Wsdl11(), in_protocol=Soap11(), out_protocol=Soap11())

And queue some tasks: ::

        producer = Producer(db, application)
        for i in range(10):
            producer.service.sleep(i)

And finally start the one worker to consume the queued tasks: ::

        consumer = Consumer(db, application, 1)
        consumer.serve_forever()

That's about it! You can switch to another database engine that accepts multiple
connections and insert tasks from another connection to see the consumer in
action. You could also start other workers in other processes to see the pub-sub
functionality.
