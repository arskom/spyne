This is a simple HelloWorld example to show the basics of writing
a webservice using rpclib, starting a server, and creating a service
client.

Here's how to call it using suds:

>>> from suds.client import Client
>>> c = Client('http://localhost:7789/?wsdl')
>>> c.service.say_hello('punk', 5)
(stringArray){
   string[] =
      "Hello, punk",
      "Hello, punk",
      "Hello, punk",
      "Hello, punk",
      "Hello, punk",
 }
>>>

'''

class HelloWorldService(ServiceBase):
    @srpc(String, Integer, _returns=Iterable(String))
    def say_hello(name, times):
        '''
        Docstrings for service methods appear as documentation in the wsdl
        <b>what fun</b>
        @param name the name to say hello to
        @param the number of times to say hello
        @return the completed array
        '''

        for i in range(times):
            yield 'Hello, %s' % name

if __name__=='__main__':

    logging.info("listening to http://127.0.0.1:7789")
    logging.info("wsdl is at: http://localhost:7789/?wsdl")

    wsgi_app = wsgi_soap_application([HelloWorldService], 'rpclib.examples.hello.soap')
    server = make_server('127.0.0.1', 7789, wsgi_app)
    server.serve_forever()
