This is a simple HelloWorld example to show the basics of writing
a webservice using rpclib, starting a server, and creating a service
client.

Here's how to call it using suds:

>>> from suds.client import Client
>>> c = Client('http://localhost:7789/?wsdl')
>>> c.service.say_hello('punk', 5)
(stringArray){
   string[] =
      "Hello, punk",
      "Hello, punk",
      "Hello, punk",
      "Hello, punk",
      "Hello, punk",
 }
>>>

'''

class HelloWorldService(ServiceBase):
    @srpc(String, Integer, _returns=Iterable(String))
    def say_hello(name, times):
        '''
        Docstrings for service methods appear as documentation in the wsdl
        <b>what fun</b>
        @param name the name to say hello to
        @param the number of times to say hello
        @return the completed array
        '''

        for i in xrange(times):
            yield 'Hello, %s' % name

if __name__=='__main__':
    try:
        from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
    except ImportError:
        print "Error: example server code requires Python >= 2.5"

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
    logging.getLogger('rpclib.protocol.soap._base').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

    application = Application([HelloWorldService], 'rpclib.examples.hello.vanilla',
                interface=Wsdl11(), in_protocol=Soap11(), out_protocol=Soap11())

    server = make_server('127.0.0.1', 7789, WsgiApplication(application))

    print "listening to http://127.0.0.1:7789"
    print "wsdl is at: http://localhost:7789/?wsdl"

    server.serve_forever()
