This is a very simple async service that sleeps for a specified
number of seconds and then call back the caller with a message.
This kicks off a new Thread for each request, which is not recommended
for a real-world application.  Spyne does not provide any thread
management or scheduling mechanism, the service is responsible for the
execution of the async process.
