"""
This is a simple HelloWorld example to show the basics of writing
a webservice using spyne, starting a server, and creating a service
client.

Here's how to call it using suds:

>>> from suds.client import Client
>>> c = Client('http://localhost:8000/?wsdl')
>>> c.service.say_hello('punk', 5)
(stringArray){
   string[] =
      "Hello, punk",
      "Hello, punk",
      "Hello, punk",
      "Hello, punk",
      "Hello, punk",
 }
>>>

"""


from spyne import rpc, Service, ComplexModel, Iterable, Integer, Unicode

from spyne.util.simple import wsgi_soap_application


class HelloWorldService(Service):
    @rpc(Unicode, _returns=Iterable(Unicode), _body_style='bare')
    def say_hello(ctx, name):
        """
        Docstrings for service methods appear as documentation in the wsdl
        <b>what fun</b>
        @param name the name to say hello to
        @param the number of times to say hello
        @return the completed array
        """

        return u'Hello, %s' % name


if __name__ == '__main__':
    import logging

    from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
    logging.getLogger('spyne.protocol.xml').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

    logging.info("listening to http://127.0.0.1:8000")
    logging.info("wsdl is at: http://localhost:8000/?wsdl")

    wsgi_app = wsgi_soap_application([HelloWorldService], 'spyne.examples.hello.soap')
    server = make_server('127.0.0.1', 8000, wsgi_app)
    server.serve_forever()
