'''
This example is an enhanced version of the HelloWorld example that
uses event listeners to apply cross-cutting behavior to the service.
In this example, the service hooks are used to gather performance
information on both the method execution as well as the duration
of the entire call, including serialization and deserialization.

These method can be used to easily apply cross-cutting functionality
accross all methods in the service to do things like database transaction
management, logging and measuring performance. This example also
uses the user-defined context (udc) attribute of the MethodContext object
to hold the data points for this request.
