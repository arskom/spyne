'''
This example is an enhanced version of the HelloWorld example that
uses service 'hooks' to apply cross-cutting behavior to the service.
In this example, the service hooks are used to gather performance
information on both the method execution as well as the duration
of the entire call, including serialization and deserialization. The
available hooks are:

    * on_call
    * on_wsdl
    * on_wsdl_exception
    * on_method_exec
    * on_results
    * on_exception
    * on_return

These method can be used to easily apply cross-cutting functionality
accross all methods in the service to do things like database transaction
management, logging and measuring performance.  This example also
employs the threadlocal request (soaplib.wsgi_soap.request) object
to hold the data points for this request.
