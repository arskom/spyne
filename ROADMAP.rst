Roadmap and Criticism
=====================

This is an attempt to make a free-for-all area to display opinions about
possible feature directions of Spyne. Doing it in a text file in the source
repository may not be the best approach for the job, but it should be enough to
at least spark a discussion around this topic.

The following would definitely be nice to have, but are just modules that should
not cause a change in unrelated areas of Spyne.

* Support for polymorphism in XML Schema.
* Support for the JsonRpc protocol.
* Support for the JsonSchema interface document standard.
* Support for the Thrift binary protocol.
* Support for the Thrift IDL -- The Thrift Interface Definition Language.
* Support for the MessagePack IDL.
* Support for the XmlRpc standard.
* Support for EXI -- The Efficient Xml Interchange as a serializer.
* SMTP as client/server transport.
* SPDY as client/server transport.
* Support security extensions to Soap (maybe using `PyXMLSec <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyXMLSec/0.3.0>`_ ?)
* Support addressing (routing) extensions to Soap
* Add WSDL Parsing support to Soap client.
* Implement Soap 1.2 standard.
* Implement Wsdl 2.0 standard.
* Reflect transport and protocol pairs other than Soap/Http to the Wsdl.
* etc.
