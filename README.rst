**WARNING:** This is from spyne's development branch. This version is not released
yet! Latest stable release can be found in the ``2_10`` branch.

About
=====

Spyne aims to save the protocol implementers the hassle of implementing their
own remote procedure call api and the application programmers the hassle of
jumping through hoops just to expose their services using multiple protocols and
transports.

In other words, Spyne is a framework for building distributed
solutions that strictly follow the MVC pattern, where Model = `spyne.model`,
View = `spyne.protocol` and Controller = `user code`.

Spyne comes with the implementations of popular transport, protocol and
interface document standards along with a well-defined API that lets you
build on existing functionality.

Spyne currently supports the WSDL 1.1 interface description standard, along with
SOAP 1.1 and the so-called HttpRpc, XmlDocument, JsonDocument, YamlDocument,
MessagePackDocument and MessagePackRpc protocols which can be transported via Http
or ZeroMQ. The transports can be used in both a client or server setting.

The following are the primary sources of information about spyne:

* Spyne's home page (that also has the latest documentation) is: http://spyne.io/
* The latest documentation for Spyne can be found at: http://spyne.io/docs
* The official source code repository is at: https://github.com/arskom/spyne
* The official spyne discussion forum is at: http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/soap
* You can download Spyne releases from `github <http://github.com/arskom/spyne/downloads>`_
  or `pypi <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/spyne>`_.

Spyne is a generalized version of a Soap library known as soaplib. The following
legacy versions of soaplib are also available in the source repository at github
as branches:

* Soaplib-0.8 branch: http://github.com/arskom/spyne/tree/soaplib-0_8
* Soaplib-1.0 branch: http://github.com/arskom/spyne/tree/soaplib-1_0
* Soaplib-2.0 was never released as a stable package, but the branch is still
  available: http://github.com/arskom/spyne/tree/soaplib-2_0

Requirements
============

Spyne is known to work on Python versions 2.6 and 2.7. We're also looking for
volunteers to test Python 3.x.

The only hard requirement is `pytz <http://pytz.sourceforge.net/>`_ which is
available via pypi.

Additionally the following software packages are needed for various subsystems
of Spyne:

* A Wsgi server of your choice is needed to wrap
  ``spyne.server.wsgi.WsgiApplication``
* `lxml>=2.3 <http://lxml.de>`_ is needed for any xml or html related protocol.
* `SQLAlchemy <http://sqlalchemy.org>`_ is needed for
  ``spyne.model.complex.TTableModel``.
* `pyzmq <https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq>`_ is needed for
  ``spyne.client.zeromq.ZeroMQClient`` and
  ``spyne.server.zeromq.ZeroMQServer``.
* `Werkzeug <http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/>`_ is needed for using
  ``spyne.protocol.http.HttpRpc`` under a wsgi transport.
* `PyParsing<2.0 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyparsing>`_ is needed for
  using ``HttpPattern``'s with ``spyne.protocol.http.HttpRpc``\. (PyParsing>=2.x
  is Python 3 only).
* `Twisted <http://twistedmatrix.com/>`_ is needed for
  ``spyne.server.twisted.TwistedWebResource`` and
  ``spyne.client.twisted.TwistedHttpClient``.
* `Django <http://djangoproject.com/>`_ (tested with 1.2 and up) is needed for
  ``spyne.server.django.DjangoApplication`` and ``spyne.server.django.DjangoServer``.
* `Pyramid <http://pylonsproject.org/>`_ is needed for
  ``spyne.server.pyramid.PyramidApplication``.
* `msgpack-python <http://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-python/>`_ is needed for
  ``spyne.protocol.msgpack``.
* `PyYaml <https://bitbucket.org/xi/pyyaml>`_ is needed for
  ``spyne.protocol.yaml``.
* `simplejson <http://github.com/simplejson/simplejson>`_ is used when found
  for ``spyne.protocol.json``.

You are advised to add these as requirements to your own projects, as these are
only optional dependencies of Spyne, thus not handled in its setup script.

Installing
==========

You can get spyne via pypi: ::

    easy_install spyne

or you can clone from github: ::

    git clone git://github.com/arskom/spyne.git

or get the source distribution from one of the download sites and unpack it.

To install from source distribution, you should run its setup script as usual: ::

    python setup.py install [--user]

To run the tests use: ::

    pyhon setup.py test

The test script first installs every single library that Spyne integrates with,
in the current directory, so be ready to do some fiddling with your distro's
package manager in case you don't want this, or have a fully functional python
development environment ready so that packages like lxml can compile.

Finally if you want to make any changes to the Spyne code, just use ::

    python setup.py develop [--user]

so that you can painlessly test your patches.


Getting Support
===============

The main developers of Spyne lurk in the `official soap implementors
forum <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/soap/>`_ kindly operated
by python.org. That's mostly because Spyne is the continuation of soaplib,
but also because Soap is an important part of Spyne.

You can also use the 'spyne' tag to ask questions on
`Stack Overflow <http://stackoverflow.com>`_.


Contributing
============

If you wish to contribute to Spyne's development, create a personal fork
on GitHub.  When you are ready to push to the upstream repository,
submit a pull request to bring your work to the attention of the core
committers. They will respond to review your patch and act accordingly.

To save both parties time, make sure the existing tests pass. If you are
adding new functionality or fixing a bug, please have the accompanying test.
This will both help us increase test coverage and insure your use-case
is immune to feature code changes. You could also summarize in one or
two lines how your work will affect the life of Spyne users in the
CHANGELOG file.

Please follow the `PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
style guidelines for both source code and docstrings.

We could also use help with the docs, which are built from
`restructured text <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ using
`Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_.

Regular contributors may be invited to join as a core Spyne committer on
GitHub. Even if this gives the core committers the power to commit directly
to the core repository, we highly value code reviews and expect every
significant change to be committed via pull requests.


A small note about submitting Pull Requests
-------------------------------------------

Github's pull-request feature is awesome, but there's a subtlety that's not
totally obvious for newcomers: If you continue working on the branch that you
used to submit a pull request, your commits will "pollute" the pull request
until it gets merged. This is not a bug, but a feature -- it gives you the
ability to address reviewers' concerns without creating pull requests over and
over again. So, if you intend to work on other parts of spyne after submitting
a pull request, please do move your work to its own branch and never submit a
pull request from your master branch. This will give you the freedom to
continue working on Spyne while waiting for your pull request to be reviewed.
